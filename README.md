# Tricky Trivia

A functional trivia game thats not for the faint of heart. I wanted to build a trivia game that challenges you that can ask 20 random questions out of 50. I also did not want it to tell you the correct answer so that I could have a leaderboard and make it a challenge. The idea orginates from sitting across the table from my Father and him asking a question that no sane man in the world would know.

## MVP

Getting the array to work. Turns out you need commas after every object.
Finding the line of code needed to save the highscores. json.parse then figuring out just what in the heck it was doing so that I could erase the highscore board as it just said Zack on there 10 times.
Being responsive on mobile! Which was easy when I was done however after typing in every combination of numbers i could think of I almost gave up.
